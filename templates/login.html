      <h3>What is 'snaptrip'?</h3>
      
      <p>snaptrip is a web application that aims to give you a better view of your past trips in Dopplr, and to use Dopplr and Flickr together.</p>
      
      <h3>Hence the name?</h3>
      
      <p>Yes, "snap" + "trip". Imaginative, huh?</p>
      
      <h3>Why do I have to authenticate?</h3>
      
      <p>Rather than asking you to log in here, snaptrip asks you to authenticate against Dopplr (and, preferably, Flickr). That's because they already know who you are, and more importantly, how to check you are who you say you are. Since you're probably alredy logged in at each site, you should just need to approve this application. <!-- (The screens look like this: --></p>
    
      <h3>Once I've authenticated, what can I do here?</h3>
      
      <p>The main page of this site shows you a list of all your trips, past and future (you can change this once you're logged in). From there, you can work with your Flickr photostream, adding information at Flickr and Dopplr to make either site richer.</p>
      
      <h3>How do I find out more, report bugs, or leave a suggestion?</h3>
  
      <p>Just get in touch via the <a href="/form/">form</a>. Either that, or log in and start playing.</p>
